  abstract  = {The frequently changing user preferences and/or item profiles have put essential importance on the dynamic modeling of users and items in personalized recommender systems. However, due to the insufficiency of per user/item records when splitting the already sparse data across time dimension, previous methods have to restrict the drifting purchasing patterns to pre-assumed distributions, and were hardly able to model them rather directly with, for example, time series analysis. Integrating content information helps to alleviate the problem in practical systems, but the domain-dependent content knowledge is expensive to obtain due to the large amount of manual efforts.

In this paper, we make use of the large volume of textual reviews for the automatic extraction of domain knowledge, namely, the explicit features/aspects in a specific product domain. We thus degrade the product-level modeling of user preferences, which suffers from the lack of data, to the feature-level modeling, which not only grants us the ability to predict user preferences through direct time series analysis, but also allows us to know the essence under the surface of product-level changes in purchasing patterns. Besides, the expanded feature space also helps to make cold-start recommendations for users with few purchasing records.

Technically, we develop the Fourier-assisted Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (FARIMA) process to tackle with the year-long seasonal period of purchasing data to achieve daily-aware preference predictions, and we leverage the conditional opportunity models for daily-aware personalized recommendation. Extensive experimental results on real-world cosmetic purchasing data from a major e-commerce website (JD.com) in China verified both the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

  abstract  = {Reviews information is dominant for users to make online purchasing decisions in e-commerces. However, the usefulness of reviews is varied. We argue that less-useful reviews hurt model's performance, and are also less meaningful for user's reference. While some existing models utilize reviews for improving the performance of recommender systems, few of them consider the usefulness of reviews for recommendation quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel attention mechanism to explore the usefulness of reviews, and propose a Neural Attentional Regression model with Review-level Explanations (NARRE) for recommendation. Specifically, NARRE can not only predict precise ratings, but also learn the usefulness of each review simultaneously. Therefore, the highly-useful reviews are obtained which provide review-level explanations to help users make better and faster decisions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets of Amazon and Yelp on different domains show that the proposed NARRE model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation approaches, including PMF, NMF, SVD++, HFT, and DeepCoNN in terms of rating prediction, by the proposed attention model that takes review usefulness into consideration. Furthermore, the selected reviews are shown to be effective when taking existing review-usefulness ratings in the system as ground truth. Besides, crowd-sourcing based evaluations reveal that in most cases, NARRE achieves equal or even better performances than system's usefulness rating method in selecting reviews. And it is flexible to offer great help on the dominant cases in real e-commerce scenarios when the ratings on review-usefulness are not available in the system.},

This chapter reviews the existing literature on source characteristics in the context of human-human, human-computer, and human-recommender system interactions. It concludes that many social cues that have been identified as influential in other contexts have yet to be implemented and tested with respect to recommender systems.

We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our Table2Seq model and the utility of the designed copying mechanism. On the WIKIBIO and SIMPLEQUESTIONS datasets, the Table2Seq model improves the state-of-the-art results from 34.70 to 40.26 and from 33.32 to 39.12 in terms of BLEU-4 scores, respectively. Moreover, we construct an open-domain dataset WIKITABLETEXT that includes 13 318 descriptive sentences for 4962 tables. Our Table2Seq model achieves a BLEU-4 score of 38.23 on WIKITABLETEXT outperforming template-based and language model based approaches. Furthermore, through experiments on 1 M table-query pairs from a search engine, our Table2Seq model considering the structured part of a table, i.e., table attributes and table cells, as additional information outperforms a sequence-to-sequence model considering only the sequential part of a table, i.e., table caption.},

them successfully to challenging sequence problems.
In this paper we demonstrate the power
of RNNs trained with the new Hessian-Free optimizer
(HF) by applying them to character-level
language modeling tasks. The standard RNN architecture,
while effective, is not ideally suited
for such tasks, so we introduce a new RNN
variant that uses multiplicative (or “gated”) connections
which allow the current input character
to determine the transition matrix from one
hidden state vector to the next. After training
the multiplicative RNN with the HF optimizer
for five days on 8 high-end Graphics Processing
Units, we were able to surpass the performance
of the best previous single method for characterlevel
language modeling – a hierarchical nonparametric
sequence model. To our knowledge
this represents the largest recurrent neural network
application to date.},

  abstract  = {The task of data-to-text generation aims to generate descriptive texts conditioned on a number
of database records, and recent neural models have shown significant progress on this task. The
attention based encoder-decoder models with copy mechanism have achieved state-of-the-art
results on a few data-to-text datasets. However, such models still face the problem of putting
incorrect data records in the generated texts, especially on some more challenging datasets like
ROTOWIRE. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach with a delayed copy mechanism
to improve the precision of data records in the generated texts. Our approach first adopts an
encoder-decoder model to generate a template text with data slots to be filled and then leverages
a proposed delayed copy mechanism to fill in the slots with proper data records. Our delayed
copy mechanism can take into account all the information of the input data records and the
full generated template text by using double attention, position-aware attention and a pairwise
ranking loss. The two models in the two stages are trained separately. Evaluation results on the
ROTOWIRE dataset verify the efficacy of our proposed approach to generate better templates and
copy data records more precisely.},

  abstract  = {Despite the impressive improvements achieved by unsupervised deep neural networks in computer vision and NLP tasks, such improvements have not yet been observed in ranking for information retrieval. The reason may be the complexity of the ranking problem, as it is not obvious how to learn from queries and documents when no supervised signal is available. Hence, in this paper, we propose to train a neural ranking model using weak supervision, where labels are obtained automatically without human annotators or any external resources (e.g., click data). To this aim, we use the output of an unsupervised ranking model, such as BM25, as a weak supervision signal. We further train a set of simple yet effective ranking models based on feed-forward neural networks. We study their effectiveness under various learning scenarios (point-wise and pair-wise models) and using different input representations (i.e., from encoding query-document pairs into dense/sparse vectors to using word embedding representation). We train our networks using tens of millions of training instances and evaluate it on two standard collections: a homogeneous news collection (Robust) and a heterogeneous large-scale web collection (ClueWeb). Our experiments indicate that employing proper objective functions and letting the networks to learn the input representation based on weakly supervised data leads to impressive performance, with over 13% and 35% MAP improvements over the BM25 model on the Robust and the ClueWeb collections. Our findings also suggest that supervised neural ranking models can greatly benefit from pre-training on large amounts of weakly labeled data that can be easily obtained from unsupervised IR models.},
